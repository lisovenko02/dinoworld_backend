      'Quetzalcoatlus was discovered through chance by Douglas A. Lawson in 1971 - while digging for sauropods at Big Bend National Park in Texas, Lawsons team unearthed a giant wing bone fossil. The bone was so large that there was much controversy over what animal the specimen belonged to, but Lawson was able to show comparisons to Pterodactyl that confirmed it was, in fact, a new and much larger genus. Quetzalcoatlus was among the largest pterosaurs ever known, with a wingspan of 9 to 12 m (30 to 40 ft) wide and weighing 70â€“250 kg (150â€“550 lb). Wingspans of 18.3 m (60 ft) were estimated, but have since been discredited. The flying habits of Quetzalcoatlus have been debated due to its large size, with some theorizing that it was a soaring animal while others say it was completely flightless. Recent studies have shown that it would be capable of boosting itself several feet into the air with its hind legs to gain the momentum necessary for downstrokes.',

      'A rather small species of pterosaur native to Brazil with a unique appearance, Tapejara can be easily recognized by its massive crest on top of its head, which consisted of a semicircular crest over the snout and a bony prong or sail which extends back behind the head that measures a meter in length, helping it to attract mates. Its wingspan of around 4 meters makes it one of the smaller pterosaurs, while the name Tapejara translates to "Old Being".',

      'he largest member and namesake of its family (its name translates to "Lizard of the Meuse River", in reference to the location of its discovery), Mosasaurus is one of the largest marine reptiles in history, growing up to nearly 18 meters in length, and lived in the Late Cretaceous period from 82 to 65 million years ago in the Atlantic Ocean. Mosasaurus rows of sharp teeth, powerful paddle-like limbs and excellent vision make it an efficient predator, feeding on fish, cephalopods and other marine reptiles. Mosasaurus also has crocodilian-like osteoderms running down its back and tail. Mosasaurus greatly resembles Tylosaurus, but had a more robust physique. The base genome of Mosasaurus are grayish-blue with a creamy underbelly.',
